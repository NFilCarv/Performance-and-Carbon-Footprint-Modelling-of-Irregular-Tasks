This work was motivated by the arrival of a new HPC system to the University of Minho and MACC.
We Conducted advanced research on task behavior analysis and prediction in High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems.
Engineered synthetic a dataset by processing state-of-the-art data using data engineering techniques.
Developed a machine learning pipeline to characterize system task behaviors:
• Task Classification: Achieved 96.7% accuracy in distinguishing regular vs. irregular workload behavior on non-training data.
• Power Consumption Prediction: Designed a low-cost tree-based algorithm, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 280 watts (data range: 20–313,297 watts).
• Execution Run-Time Prediction: Employed stacking classification and regression models, achieving an MAE of 495 seconds (data range: 0–86,395 seconds).
Results highlighted a clear error distribution, with lower percentiles yielding significantly lower errors, demonstrating robust performance.
